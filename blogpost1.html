                <h2>For family-friendly beachside fun, it’s hard to beat Point Pleasant Beach.</h2>
                <p>
                    The expansive beach is kept crystal clean and the Boardwalk is great for kids (of any age) with dozens of rides along with games of chance, some of the most competitive miniature golf at the beach and Jenkinson’s Aquarium.
                    
                    All of the required indulgences are offered along the mile-long Boardwalk, including waffles and ice cream, sausage and peppers, popcorn and cotton candy. There are numerous other dining opportunities, from on-the-go to full-service.
                
                    
                    And if it’s not beach weather, don’t despair: <u>Point Pleasant Beach is also an antiquers’ delight.</u> Both Bay and Arnold Avenues have a number of spots to hunt for hidden treasures and the Point Pavillion Antique Centre offers over 40 dealers conveniently located under one roof.</p>
