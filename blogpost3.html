                <h2>Park Overview</h2>
                <p> The 32 acre park was created in 1957. The main attraction is the lighthouse, which you  can climb to the lightkeepers catwalk. 
                    <u>There are 217 steps that lead to the lighthouse.</u> From there you can see a long ways on a clear day. If you are familiar with this area of the Jersey shore and have never seen the area from up high, the view from the lighthouse will be even more special. In all areas of the lighthouse you will find interpretive signs that discuss the history and role of lighthouses, in addition to specific details about the Barnegat Lighthouse itself. Besides the lighthouse people come to the park to walk, birdwatch, learn about maritime history and fish.   </p>
