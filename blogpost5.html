                <h2>Southern Shore Region</h2>
                <p>     
                    Fine wines, outstanding restaurants, classic jazz festivals and special events year 'round. Some things just get better with age, and charming Cape May is no exception. This historic Victorian seaside gem is the oldest resort and one of the most beautiful spots in the country. The entire city is a <u>National Historic District,</u> with nearly 600 preserved Victorian buildings.
                    Trolley tours take in the historic district, as does the popular evening ghost tour. And of course dozens of Victorian B&Bs stand with rocking chairs at the ready.

                    The natural beauty of the southernmost beach in the state has been a draw for centuries. A lovely promenade runs along the sand, perfect for biking or jogging. On Sunset Beach, you can search for Cape May Diamonds (polished quartz that washes up on shore).
